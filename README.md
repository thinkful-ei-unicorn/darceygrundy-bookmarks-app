-----Bookmark App User Stories-----

App will display a list of preselected bookmarks and allow user to add their own.
All bookmarks need a title, star rating and the link obviously.
They can also have descriptions that are optional.
The front page display bookmarks, an option to add new ones, and a way to sort bookmarks by rating.
The front page also shows the previously-added bookmarks, but only displays the title and star rating.
Clicking on one of the displayed bookmarks will allow the user to see more details like descriptions and allows you to visit the link.
On the add bookmark page, it will prompt you for each required portion and will send you to an error when you leave out any of them.
When you successfully add a new bookmark, it will prompt the original page with the added bookmark shown.
